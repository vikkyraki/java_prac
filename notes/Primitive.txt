boolean -> 1 bit -> 1/0
char -> 2 bytes -> 16 bits -> UNICODE

byte -> 8 bits .. -128 .. 127
short -> 16 bits .. -32768 .. 32767
int -> 32 bits
long -> 64 bits

float -> 4 bytes
double -> 8 bytes

float :

32 -> 1(signed) + 8(exponent) + 23 (significand)
64 -> 1(signed) + 11(exponent) + 52

float vs double which to use -> double performance is higher, java library math functions are written in java, and double speed with cpu is high

String: large number of characters -> max num -> limited by memory or MAX_VALUE of int

casting..

    small to big automatically converted by compiler.
    when two different types are used in expression, then the smaller one is automatically casted to the bigger one and then the operation is performed.
