we can't instance methods, keywords, this, super


instance methods :
    need object to use them
    they can access instance methods, variables, static methods and static variables directly

static:
    attributes : shared b/w instances. updated value will be the last changed value
    methods : cannot access instance methods, values
    classes
    blocks // this will come first, then the constructor works
