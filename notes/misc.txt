reference types vs value types

There are two kinds of memory used in Java. These are called stack memory and heap memory.
Stack memory stores primitive types and the addresses of objects. The object values are stored in heap memory.
An object reference on the stack is only an address that refers to the place in heap memory where that object is kept.
