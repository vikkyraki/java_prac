abstraction :
    what needs to be implemented -> we dont care how they are implemented
    List, anyone can implement New DS, but they should implement methods from List, and we dont care how they implement them.

abstract:
    they can't be instantiated
    they can have normal methods, which are common functionality across all implementations .. similar to inheritance but there should be atleast one abstract class.

    they can have constructors .. as they have instace variable, non abstract methods, so we need to properly initialize them
    the methods can be private/public..


interface:
    just a bunch methods definitions
    they can't be instantiated
    complete abstract class

    methods -> default : abstract, public
    attributes -> public static final
