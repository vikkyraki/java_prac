JDK comes in many flavours,
many vendors and many versions


versions :

Normal versions come every 6 months, and their support ends after 6 months.
LTS versions comes every 3 years, and their support time is large.

So companies generally prefer lts versions, so as they frequently dont change their code for compatibility issues.
